Dr. DaviV. Q. Rodrigues received the B.S. degree in communications engineering from the Military Institute of Engineering, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2017, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA, in 2023. He is an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA.

Prior to academia, Dr. Rodrigues served first with the Brazilian Navy, and later with the Brazilian Army, where he was commissioned as First Lieutenant. He joined Texas Tech University as a Research Assistant in the Fall of 2018. In the Summer of 2021, he was with Uhnder, Inc., Austin, TX, USA, where he was involved in the design and evaluation of signal processing algorithms for mitigation of radar interference. In the Spring and Summer of 2022, he was with Abbott Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA, USA, where he worked on the design of antennas and microwave systems for implantable medical devices. In the Fall of 2022, he conducted research on wireless networks assisted by intelligent reflective surfaces at the Advanced Wireless R&D Group, Global Office of the CTO, Dell Technologies. His current research interests include signal processing for radar and communication systems, wireless sensors for smart living and biomedical applications, and microwave/millimeter-wave circuits. 

Dr. Rodrigues was a recipient of the IEEE MTT-S Tom Brazil Graduate Fellowship Award, the Texas Tech Horn Distinguished Professors Graduate Achievement Award, and the University of Texas System Rising STARs Award.
